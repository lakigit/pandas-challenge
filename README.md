# Background of the Repository
In this assignment, help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
To analyse this result, I used the Python pandas notebook. 
This project used two CSV files, school_complete and student_complete. 
For the analysis, merged these two data sets on the school name. 
The first task is, to analyse the local government area summary. It includes the following. 
[Total number of unique schools
Total Students
Total budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)]
**Note**: **passing grade is 50 or higher**
And the second task is, to analyse the school summary. Here, Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school. Include the following:
[School name
School type
Total Students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)]
And also find Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Maths Scores by Year, Reading Scores by Year, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, Scores by School Type. 

# Analysis 
**School Summary:**
First, check about missing values and there weren't any missing values. 

|Total Schools	|Total Students	|Total Budget	|Average Maths Score	|Average Reading Score	|% Passing Maths	|% Passing Reading	|% Overall Passing
|-------------  |-------------- |-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
|15	            |39,170	        |$24,649,428.00	      |70.338192	            |69.980138	      |86.078632	  |84.426857	        |72.808272

Based on this table, it appears that there are a total of 15 schools with a combined student population of 39,170. Interestingly, the data suggests that math performance is stronger than reading performance within this area. Additionally, the overall passing rate indicates a satisfactory level of achievement across the board.
